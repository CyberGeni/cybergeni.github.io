# brag book
yoo. welcome to my timeline.

this is as the name goes, a brag book. sometimes I loose sight of some tiny accomplishments I've had and some little wins, and do feel like I ain't doing enough. so this is basically where I can outline all my tech wins, little and big, and see if it helps me stay sane. visit here if you want to know what i've been up to... tech wise. 

might as well turn this to a reality blog, who knows?

stay jiggy,
cG✌🏾
